Bloom Board is a social media application build with React where users can create their boards, 
containing their most favorite memories and share it with other people. It includes custom user authentication with a fully integrated database and can be said as a complete MERN application. It also exploits Redux functionalities and uses Material UI to create a beautiful but modern design.
